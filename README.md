LAB 1


The objective of this lab program was to handle a csv file that consisted of the data of bank users. The program enabled us to create menu driven program with the help of certain user defined functions.

The program basically make use of certain important functions in python programming like open, userdefined function,conditional statements etc. The program included about four questions in which the user was asked to read the file, find out the headers, count the customers in a particular category 'marital' and create a histogram based on the age. The catch of the program was that the code should be executed in such a way that it should not contain any of the libraries in python programming.
